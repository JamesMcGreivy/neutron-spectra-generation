## This is the repository for the paper "[Data Augmentation for Neutron Spectrum Unfolding with Neural Networks](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4362/4/1/6)". 

This repository contains feature engineering algorithms for generating physically motivated neutron energy spectra, to be used for training neutron spectrum unfolding neural networks. These algorithms address the challenge of acquiring real-world data to train unfolding neural networks, and reduce the reliance on costly experimental data. The repository provides the necessary tools to replicate the results of the paper and to implement your own spectra generation methods to enhance the robustness of an unfolding neural network.
